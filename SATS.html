				The SAT or ACT are perhaps the most important testing results that you will submit to your colleges. It is important therefore that you take their preparation seriously. Typically, you will take either the SAT Reasoning Test or the ACT, and two or three subject tests. Almost all schools accept the SAT, and an increasing majority of schools accept the ACT. Always check on the website of the university to which you are applying to be sure of what they require for admission.</br></br>

				</div>
				<hr id="inText">

				The SAT, previously called the Scholastic Aptitude Test, consists of three sections, Reading, Math and Writing and Language, and an optional essay.Each section score is scaled to a score out of 800, and the maximum total score is 1600. The sections of the SAT consist of:

				<!--ADD MORE STUFF HERE-->
				<ul id="ulshaded">
				</br>
				<div id="small">
				<li><h4 style= "font-size: 20px; color:#7B5EA0"> Evidence-Based Reading and Writing</h4></div>
				This section is divided into two: the Reading Test and the Writing and Language test. The Reading Test has five passages that test your ability to synthesize information and answer questions from it. These passages are on classic or contemporary works, works of great historical significance, the social sciences, and scientific passages. Donâ€™t worry if you do not recognize or kn0w about the subject matter of the passage, all the information you need to answer the questions is right there in them. The Writing and Language Test asks you to read through text and find grammatical errors if they exist. This section tests your knowledge of the usage and mechanics of the English language. This section is 65 minutes long. </li>


				<div id="small">
				<li><h4 style= "font-size: 20px; color:#7B5EA0"> Math</h4></div>
				This section tests your mathematical ability in algebra, problem-solving, data analysis, and advanced mathematics. Your high school mathematics course has prepared you sufficiently to tackle this section, but you need to practice a lot to ensure you are able to finish the questions in the required time. This section is 80 minutes long. 
				</li>

				<div id="small">
				<li><h4 style= "font-size: 20px; color:#7B5EA0"> Optional Essay</h4></div>
				This essay presents you with a passage, and requires you to explain how the author persuades the reader with their arguments. This essay requires you to have a good grasp of how rhetorical reasoning is built. You are not required to give your own view on the topic at hand, just how the author uses language and stylistic devices to put their point across in a convincing manner. You will have 50 minutes to write the essay. 
				</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="titles" >What is the ACT?</h3>	
				<p style= "color: #716F73; font-size: 16px;">ACT NI NINI?</p>
				</div>
				<hr id="inText">
				ACT, which originally stood for American College Testing, is a standardized test that has a required part and a non-required part. The required part consists of English, Mathematics, Reading and Science sections. The optional section is a writing test, that we generally recommend you take, as it is an opportunity to show the college your writing capabilities. You earn one mark for each correct answer, and your scores in each section are scaled to a score between one and 36. Your final ACT score is the average of your score in the four sections, with the minimum score as 1 and a maximum score of 36. It has the following sections:
				

				<ul id="ulshaded">
				</br>
				<div id="small">
				<li><h4 style= "font-size: 20px; color:#7B5EA0"> English</h4></div>
				This section, 45 minutes long, is a 75-question test that has five medium-length passages. 
				Each passage has underlined portions which may or may not have correct grammar. You are required to identify mistakes in the usage of language and grammar-such as punctuation, run-on sentences, and ambiguous phrases.

				</li>

				<div id="small">
				<li><h4 style= "font-size: 20px; color:#7B5EA0"> Math</h4>
				 </div>
				This section has 60 questions and is 60 minutes long
				This section tests pre-algebra, algebra, trigonometry, and geometry. With very few exceptions, your high school mathematics course will suffice for this test. Your main concern here should be speed, as you only have approximately one minute per question if you want to have time to check your work at the end.

				</li>

				<div id="small">
				<li><h4 style= "font-size: 20px; color:#7B5EA0"> Reading</h4></div>
				This section is like the Comprehension passages that you are already familiar with.
				In 35 minutes, you are needed to answer 40 questions, with 10 questions from each reading passage. The passages cover a wide range of topics. Here, your speed is of the essence too, and you will need to read strategically to ensure you finish the section in time.
				</li>

				<div id="small">
				<li><h4 style= "font-size: 20px; color:#7B5EA0"> Science</h4></div>
				The science test is also a 40-question test administered in 35 minutes.
				 You will have seven short passages, each with between 5 to 7 questions. You generally do not need prior science knowledge to answer these questions, as the passages provide all the information you need. 
				</li>
				</ul>

				</div>
				<hr id="inText">
				The SAT subject tests are one hour long tests offered in about 20 subjects. These show your aptitude in individual subjects. You can take up to three subject tests on any given test day. Since the subject material is not exactly the same as what you have studied in high school, take a range of practice tests, then choose two or three subjects that you are comfortable in, and study for those. Be aware, though, that if you are taking two tests, you cannot take only Mathematics Level one and two.

				<p style= "color: #716F73; font-size: 16px;">TOEFL NI NINI?</p>
				</div>
				<hr id="inText">
				

			This is the Test of English as a Foreign Language. Some schools do not require it at all, while some universities only require it if your SAT or ACT score falls beneath a certain range. Yet others require it for all non-US applicants. Check with the admissions requirements of the schools you are applying to to confirm this.

				The SAT Reasoning Test is offered internationally in October, December, March, and May. The SAT Subject Tests are offered internationally in June, October, December, and May. The ACT is offered in June, September, October, and December. The TOEFL exam is offered every two weeks. The registration deadlines for these tests are typically one to two months in advance of the test, so make sure you register in time.   </br></br>

				<h3 class="titles" >Registering for the tests</h3>	
				<p style= "color: #716F73; font-size: 16px;">LOL THIS IS JUST GETTING FUNNY NOW</p>
				</div>
				<hr id="inText">
				
				In Kenya, registration for the SAT is done either by the Learning and Testing Services, located in Taj Tower, Upperhill, Nairobi, or online. If you are paying in person, you can pay for the test by depositing cash in their CBA bank account and taking your receipt to their offices. If you are registering online, all you need is your debit or credit card to pay for the test.</br></br>
 
				For the ACT exam, you can only pay online, and so you will need a debit/credit card for this too.</br></br>
				 
				You will also need 2x2 passport sized photos, and we recommend that you carry a form of photo identification that has your full name and date of birth with you. Examples of these are your National Identification card or your passport. Make sure you carry them on test day too, as you will not sit the exam without proper identification.</br></br>

				</br><div id="small">
				<h3 class="titles" >Resources you will need</h3>	
				<p style= "color: #716F73; font-size: 16px;">PREPARING FOR YOUR STANDARDIZED TESTS</p>
				</div>
				<hr id="inText">
				The College Board website is your first stop for SAT preparation. In what is famously known as the blue book, you will find ten sample exams that will familiarize you with the requirements of the test and how you should answer questions. The official ACT website is naturally your first stop for ACT preparation materials. Another good resource is the Princeton Review series of books. Once you are done with these, you can search online for more resources, but these tend to be less similar than the official practice tests. </br></br>

				Since these books are expensive, you may want to check out the American Reference Library located at the US Embassy in Nairobi. You need a form of identification to become a member, and then you can check out revision books. In addition, for general advising, you can visit the American Spaces in Nairobi and Nakuru at this <a href=https://ke.usembassy.gov/education-culture/educationusa/ target="_blank">link</a>.

				</br></br>
				We highly recommend that you study with a friend to stay motivated, and time each other as you do practice tests so that you are conscious of how much time you spend on the test. Be aware that you will typically spend 20% more time answering questions on the real test, so you want to be sure that you can finish the test in slightly less time than is set.
