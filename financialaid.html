				As is normal with all great institutions, there is a cost of attendance for most of the schools you are hoping to get into. However, the schools cost a lot of money, and given the median income in Kenya, the amount you are expected to pay is probably way more than you ever planned on spending on your college application.</br></br>

				Thankfully, most of the institutions that you are applying to are pretty generous and they offer financial aid that meets the need of the applicant.

				<ul  id= "ulshaded">
				<li style=  "font-size: 26px; color: #775F95">Need Blind</li>	
				When a college maintains a need blind admission policy, it accepts students without regard to the applicant’s financial need. However, some schools that call themselves need blind will not provide sufficient money in their financial aid packages.
				</br></br>

				<li style=  "font-size: 26px; color: #775F95">Need Aware</li>	
				At schools with need-aware policies, schools do examine the financial need of students. Many, students, however, are selected regardless of their financial neediness. But if the school admits you, they will meet your full financial needFor 
				</br></br>
				</ul>

				Grants are a type of financial aid that do not require repayment. Grants may be: merit-based, need-based or student-specific(minorities, women, and international students).</br></br>
				
				<li style=  "font-size: 26px; color: #775F95">Scholarships</li>		
				Like grants, scholarships do not require repayment. They are typically offered by individual institutions and private organizations and can be awarded based on: merit  athletic ability, religious affiliation, and race, among others. </br></br>
	
				<li style=  "font-size: 26px; color: #775F95">Work Study</li>	
				A work-study program is a work program where you can earn money that helps you pay for school.  As part of the financial aid award some schools have a work study requirement,. The money you earn usually covers personal expenses that you may incur in the course of your study.</br></br>
